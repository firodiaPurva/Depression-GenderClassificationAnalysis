        "Great, it sounds like you've made good progress by merging the CSV files and preparing the data with the feature descriptions and labels. After this step, here's what you can do next:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Handle Missing Values**: Check if there are any missing values in your merged dataframes (`traindf` and `testdf`). If there are, decide on an appropriate strategy for handling them, such as imputation or removal of rows with missing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Normalize or Scale Features**: Since you have numeric features, it's a good practice to normalize or scale them to ensure that they're on a similar scale. This can improve the performance of certain machine learning algorithms, especially those sensitive to the scale of features. You can use techniques like Min-Max scaling or standardization.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Split Data**: Separate the features (acoustic features) from the target variables (depression labels and gender labels) in both the training and test data. This will allow you to train and evaluate your machine learning models properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Train ML Models**:\n",
        "   - For depression classification:\n",
        "     - Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine) and train it on the training data with the depression labels as the target variable.\n",
        "   - For gender classification:\n",
        "     - Similarly, choose an appropriate ML algorithm and train it on the training data with the gender labels as the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Evaluate Model Performance**:\n",
        "   - After training the models, use them to predict depression labels for the test data in the depression classification task and gender labels for the gender classification task.\n",
        "   - Calculate the simple classification accuracy (`A`) and the balanced classification accuracy (`BA`) on the test set for both tasks.\n",
        "   - Compute these metrics separately for female and male participants to assess performance across gender groups.\n",
        "   - Additionally, calculate the equality of opportunity (`EO`) for depression classification as described in the task.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Discuss Findings**: Interpret the results of your classification experiments, including accuracy, balanced accuracy, and equality of opportunity. Discuss any observations or insights gained from the evaluation metrics, particularly regarding gender bias and performance differences across gender groups."
